# FlutterWebTools

[![Tests](https://github.com/fischerscode/FlutterWebTools/actions/workflows/tests.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fischerscode/FlutterWebTools/actions/workflows/tests.yaml)

Currently the FlutterWebTools allow you to append either the version counter or the build ID to the `main.dart.js` reference in the `index.html` and all `/version.json` references in the `main.dart.js` itself.

This is useful to prevent browsers to cache an old version of your application.
